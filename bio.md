My name is Patrick, and this is my third term in the OSU computer science program. 
Some of my favorite hobbies include playing and watching basketball (go Blazers!), 
and spending time with my beautiful dog and girlfriend (not necessarily in that 
order).

Second non-programming bio add: Fun fact - I received my first undergraduate degree from 
the University of Oregon. As an Oregon native, I have always wished OSU well and generally 
supported the school, but it is weird to now be attending OSU, even if it is just as an 
ecampus student. I will always be a Duck.
