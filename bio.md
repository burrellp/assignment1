My name is Patrick, and this is my third term in the OSU computer science program. 
Some of my favorite hobbies include playing and watching basketball (go Blazers!), 
and spending time with my beautiful dog and girlfriend (not necessarily in that 
order).

#Programming Background
Before starting this program, my experience was very limited. I took two intro level
programming courses on Coursera that were in Python and made it through about half
of the Codecademy course on Python. That was pretty much the extent of it before CS 161.
