My name is Patrick, and this is my third term in the OSU computer science program. 
Some of my favorite hobbies include playing and watching basketball (go Blazers!), 
and spending time with my beautiful dog and girlfriend (not necessarily in that 
order).

Second non-programming bio add: Fun fact - I received my first undergraduate degree from 
the University of Oregon. As an Oregon native, I have always wished OSU well and generally 
supported the school, but it is weird to now be attending OSU, even if it is just as an 
ecampus student. I will always be a Duck. 

#Programming Background
Before starting this program, my experience was very limited. I took two intro level
programming courses on Coursera that were in Python and made it through about half
of the Codecademy course on Python. That was pretty much the extent of it before CS 161.

It's hard to pick a favorite assignment from CS 161 and 162. 162 involved building
several simple fantasy/text-adventure type games and that's not really my thing. I did
enjoy working with a class hierarchy on those types of assigments though, especially
on the final project when we had the freedom to design our own from scratch. I have
grown to enjoy OOD/OOP.
